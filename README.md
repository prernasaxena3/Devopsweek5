Steps to Complete the Assignment
1. Setting Up a Domain

Create an Azure Account:

I started by creating an Azure account and logging into the Azure portal.

Register a Domain:

I registered a domain through a domain registrar service (e.g., GoDaddy).

2. Setting Up a Server on a VM

Create a Virtual Machine (VM):

I navigated to the Azure portal and created a new Virtual Machine.
I selected the desired operating system (e.g., Ubuntu) and configured the necessary settings like size, resource group, and network.

Configure the VM:

Once the VM was created, I connected to it via SSH using the provided public IP address.
I installed necessary software and configured the server environment according to my requirements.
3. Using the DNS Server for Traffic Management

Configure DNS Settings:

I accessed the DNS settings in my domain registrar account.
I updated the DNS records to point to the public IP address of my Azure VM.

Test DNS Configuration:

I used tools like nslookup and ping to verify that the domain name was correctly resolving to the VMâ€™s IP address.
4. Creating and Testing Azure Application Gateway

Create an Application Gateway:

I followed the steps in the Azure portal to create a new Application Gateway.
I configured the frontend IP, backend pool, and routing rules.

Configure Backend Pool:

I added my VM to the backend pool of the Application Gateway.
Set Up Health Probes and Listeners:

I configured health probes to monitor the status of my VM.
I set up listeners to handle incoming traffic on the specified ports.

Test the Application Gateway:

I accessed the public IP of the Application Gateway to verify that it correctly routed traffic to my VM.
I performed various tests to ensure that the Application Gateway was working as expected.
